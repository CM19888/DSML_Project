# Ebox Project

This python code will look for putative E-box sequences within fasta file sequences. It will supply how many there are and at what position in the sequence they are. 

To run:
1. Ensure that you have the following python packages installed: Biopython, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
2. Download the jupiter notebook
3. Download FASTA files of sequences you wish to search, either from the examples in this github directory or any alternative sequences you wish to analyse.
	(Note: if you choose to use your own FASTA files you will need to edit in the filenames at the various highlighted points!)
3. Ensure these FASTA files are in the same directory as the jupyter notebook
4. Run the code on the notebook!
