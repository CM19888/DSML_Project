# Ebox Project

This python code will look for putative E-box sequences within fasta file sequences. It will supply how many there are and at what position in the sequence they are. 

To run:
1. Ensure that you have the following python packages installed: Biopython, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
	(Note: If you are using the Anaconda and have not previously done already you will need to install Biopython)
2. Download the jupyter notebook EboxProject.ipynb
3. Download FASTA files of sequences you wish to search, either from the examples in this github directory or any alternative sequences you wish to analyse.
	(Note: if you choose to use your own FASTA files you will need to edit in the filenames at the various highlighted points in the code!)
3. Ensure these FASTA files are in the same directory as the jupyter notebook
4. Run the code on the notebook!

To install Biopython using Anaconda through the Environments:
1. Go to "Environments" tab on the Anaconda Navigator
2. Pick the environment use wish to install Biopython (in base or your own)
3. Use the drop down menu to look at "All" packages
4. Select Biopython for installation
